First day of work. I'm getting things set up. 
New terminal: iTerm2, p10k
New VSCode theme: MacOS Modern
New github: thebarefoot

Having worked with IT since 2012, started coding in 2007, it's kind of embarassing that I got to 2021 witout having a proper profile here on github.
Professional work, personal life can get you far from code - and his, to me, will be a place to reconnect with what I do, and do good: coding. 
So, this will be a github dedicated on some personal projects that I've long thought about, but never got serious about developing.

First big one: a Magic, The Gathering, card sorter and database builder.
Let's see how far this goes!
